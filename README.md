# League of Legends Arena - Randomize Teams and Champions

[Link to App - will be in the future]()

Arena is one of the game modes in Leauge of Legends. In patch 13.24 they added possibility to play game with 8 people, so after many games with friends we started to randomize teams and champions. To make this process easier, I created a simple application that can randomize teams and chempions.
